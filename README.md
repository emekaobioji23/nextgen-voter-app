#NextGen Backend Personal Project: E-Voting Application

Project Duration: 3 weeks

User category: Admin and a voter

For an admin, 
    I should be able to sign up and sign into the application with basic information like my username (email address), password and account details. 
    I should be able to create a voting room which would include different contestants for a particular award or position that is unique to me. 
    The contestants details should include name, image, unique username which should be used to create a user under the hood that is referenced to the voting room. 
    Also the voting room should be for  a particular period of time after which voting is not allowed for that particular voting room. 
    A unique link should be generated to access the voting room, this link can be shared to voters.

As a voter, 
    I should be able to access a voting room using the shared link and view all participants in that room. 
    I should then be able to vote for my desired participant, this can be done by making a payment according to the amounts of votes I intend to give to my desired participant. 
    A single vote should cost 50 naira. I can re-vote as many times as I like.
